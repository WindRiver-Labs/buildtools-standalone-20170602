Prebuilt build tools
==============================================

The buildtools in this directory are used to provide specific versions of
software to aid in the setup and use of a Wind River Linux project.

To make the use of the buildtools, the binaries are automatically 
installed by setup and added to PATH by the oe-init-build-env scripts.

Rebuilding of prebuilts
-----------------------

setup a new project, using --machine=qemux86-64
create a new build directory using oe-init-build-env
bitbake buildtools-tarball

The result of the build is in tmp/deploy/sdk as
<sdkmachine>-buildtools-nativesdk-standalone-<version>.sh

In order to build the i686 version, either set SDKMACHINE=i686 in the
environment prior to calling bitbake, or in the builds local.conf file.
